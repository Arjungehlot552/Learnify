          Our Mission
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          At Learnify, our mission is to create a collaborative platform where
          students and professionals can share, discover, and collaborate on
          projects from various domains and institutions. We believe that by
          providing a central hub for project sharing, we can prevent valuable
          work from being isolated and discarded, and instead, inspire
          innovation and knowledge exchange. Learnify was conceived with a
          singular vision: to create a centralized hub where students from
          diverse colleges and universities can upload, share, and explore
          projects, ideas, and academic achievements. We are committed to
          preventing student projects from being isolated and underutilized by
          providing a platform that encourages knowledge sharing and
          collaboration. Our mission is to empower students by giving their work
          the visibility it deserves and fostering a community where ideas can
          thrive and inspire.
